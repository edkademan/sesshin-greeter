* Generate sesshin documents

** Description
   The sdocs program is a command-line utility that usually takes just
   two arguments: an input directory and an output directory. The
   input directory contains the source information in the form of
   tab-separated-variable tables and the output directory holds the
   pdf results. The test-data/good subdirectory included in this
   distribution contains examples. The only files necessary are

     - jobs.tsv
     - rooms.tsv
     - roster.tsv
     - showers.tsv
     - shower-times.tsv
       
   The roster.tsv file is the most important and is probably the only
   one that will change from sesshin to sesshin. It lists for each
   individual participant that participant's room, possible shower,
   possible shower time, job, and so on. The other files simply
   describe their respective items. For example, rooms.tsv lists the
   allowable room numbers, and shower-times.tsv lists the possible
   shower times.  In what follows the word "showers" refers both to
   showers and to the soaking baths.

   You can assign to each individual participant a particular shower
   but you don't have to. If you don't the system will assign one for
   you. The same is true for shower times. If you leave that field
   blank the system will pick a time for that individual. The shower
   that it picks will be close to that person's bedroom and the time
   that it picks will not conflict with that person's job. Also, you
   can specify a "shower time" that is actually a long span that
   implies several possible shower time slots. For example, if you
   describe the beginning and ending shower times as "8:00am 2:00pm"
   the program will pick some slot either in the rest period
   immediately after the morning work period or in the period
   immediately after lunch, and will not pick one later in the day. To
   summarize, you can assign

     - a shower and a shower time,
     - a shower with no shower time,
     - a shower time with no shower or
     - neither a shower or shower time.

   In addition to generating the pdf documents sdocs checks to make
   sure the information is coherent and complains if:

     - someone doesn't have a job, or has a job that it doesn't
       recognize
     - there is a job for which no one was assigned
     - someone wasn't assigned a room or was assigned a room that it
       doesn't recognize
     - someone wasn't assigned a shower or was assigned a shower that
       it doesn't recognize
     - someone wasn't assigned a shower time or was assigned one that
       it doesn't recognize
     - more people were assigned to take a bath at the same time than
       that bath can accommodate.

   It will try to generate the documents even in the presence of what
   it sees as problems since they may not actually be problems. (You
   might be allowing the program to choose shower assignments in the
   way described above for example.)

** Operation
   You must open a command prompt window with the Windows CMD
   program. Once inside navigate to the "bin" directory in this
   distribution using cd and do

   #+begin_example
     sdocs -i <input directory> -o <output directory>
   #+end_example

   where you replace <input directory> and <output directory> with the
   actual directory names. The output directory must exist already.

   A realistic-looking invocation with command prompt might look like

   #+begin_example
     > sdocs -i C:\Users\Ed\2018-01-sesshin -o C:\Users\Ed\pdfs
   #+end_example

   You don't have to make the bin directory current before you do this
   but if you don't then you need to qualify sdocs with the directory
   path so Windows can find it. For example, instead of "sdocs" you
   might type "sesshin-greeter\bin\sdocs".

   sdocs puts a title on each of the pages it generates. So in
   addition to specifying input and output directories on the command
   line you can also specify a title if you don't like the default one
   it chooses.

   #+begin_example
     > sdocs -i <...> -o <...> -t "April 2018 7-day Sesshin"
   #+end_example
